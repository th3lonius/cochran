        <h2>Weisman Art Museum</h2><br/><br/><h3 class="h3-alt">Minneapolis, Minnesota (1993)</h3><br/><br/><br/>
        <p class="uppercase">The Frederick R. Weisman Art Museum is an art museum located on the University of Minnesota campus in Minneapolis. A teaching museum for the university since 1934, the museum is named for Frederick R. Weisman, and was designed by the renowned architect Frank Gehry. Often called a "modern art museum," the 20,000+ image collection has large collections of Marsden Hartley, Alfred Maurer, Charles Biederman, Native American Mimbres pottery, and Korean furniture.</p><br/>
        <p>The museum's current building, designed by renowned architect Frank Gehry, was completed in 1993. The stainless steel skin was fabricated and installed by the A. Zahner Company, a frequent collaborator with Gehry's office.</p><br/>
<p>It is one of the major landmarks on campus, situated on a bluff overlooking the Mississippi River at the east end of the Washington Avenue Bridge. The building presents two faces, depending on which side it is viewed from. From the campus side, it presents a brick facade that blends with the existing brick and sandstone buildings. On the opposite side, the museum is a playground of curving and angular brushed steel sheets. This side is an abstraction of a waterfall and a fish.</p><br/>
    <p>The most stunning views of the building are from the pedestrian and highway decks of the adjacent Washington Avenue Bridge. Some locals critical of the radical architectural style frequently point out that the building's design could unexpectedly reflect the light of the sun into the eyes of motorists on the bridge. Studies commissioned by MNDOT have found that the museum is not hazardous to motorists.</p><br/>
        <p>A new addition, also designed by Gehry, was expected to open in 2009. However, due to economic conditions, construction did not begin until the spring of 2010. The Weisman closed its doors on Sunday, October 10, 2010 until the fall of 2011 as a part of this major expansion. The museum reopened its doors with a Grand Reopening celebration sponsored by Target on Sunday, October 2, 2011. The Weisman's five new galleries allow the museum to share more than three times as many objects from the permanent collection at any given time. One new gallery is filled with highlights from their noted ceramics collection (master potter Warren MacKenzie helped select the work); two house master works of American modernism; and another showcases the Weisman's considerable collection of photography, prints, and drawings. The fifth new gallery, the Target Studio for Creative Collaboration, houses experimental collaborations between artists and students, faculty, and the community</p>
