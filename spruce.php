        <h2>8 Spruce Street</h2><br/><br/><h3 class="h3-alt">New York, New York (2011)</h3><br/><br/><br/>
        <p class="uppercase">8 Spruce Street, originally known as Beekman Tower and currently marketed as New York by Gehry, is a 76-story skyscraper designed by architect Frank Gehry in the New York City borough of Manhattan at 8 Spruce Street in Lower Manhattan, just south of City Hall Plaza and the Brooklyn Bridge.</p><br/>
        <p>According to its official website, at 265 meters (870 feet) high, 8 Spruce Street will be the 12th tallest residential tower in the world and the second tallest residential building in the Western Hemisphere, upon the completion of One57, also in New York City. Completed in February 2011, the building was developed by Forest City Ratner, designed by Frank Gehry Architects and WSP Cantor Seinuk Structural Engineers, and constructed by Kreisler Borg Florman. It contains a public elementary school owned by the Department of Education. Above that and grade-level retail, the tower contains only residential rental units (898 in total), a rarity in New York’s Financial District. The skyscraper's structural frame is reinforced concrete, and in height and form, it bears a resemblance to Aqua, a 2009 skyscraper in Chicago.</p><br/>
<p>The school is sheathed reddish-tan brick, and covers 100,000 square feet (9,300 m2) of the first five floors of the building. It will host over 600 students enrolled in pre-kindergarten through eighth grade classes. A fourth floor roof deck will hold 5,000 square feet (460 m2) of outdoor play space.</p><br/>
    <p>Above the elementary school is an 898 unit luxury residential tower clad in stainless steel. The apartments range from 500 to 1,600 square feet (150 m2), and consist of studios, one-, two- and three-bedroom units. All units are priced at market-rate, with no low or moderate income-restricted apartments. It does not contain any units for purchase.</p><br/>
    <p>The building also includes space for New York Downtown Hospital. The hospital will take up 25,000 square feet (2,300 m2), and will have public parking below ground. There will be public plazas on both the east and west sides of the building, one 11,000 square feet (1,000 m2) and the other somewhat smaller. Street-level retail, totaling approximately 1,300–2,500 square feet, is included as part of the project.</p>
    <p>Early reviews of the 8 Spruce Street tower have been favorable. In The New York Times, architecture critic Nicolai Ouroussoff praised the building's design as a welcome addition to the skyline of New York, calling it: "the finest skyscraper to rise in New York since Eero Saarinen’s CBS building went up 46 years ago". New Yorker magazine's Paul Goldberger described it as "one of the most beautiful towers downtown". Comparing Gehry's tower to the nearby Woolworth Building, completed in 1913, Goldberger said "it is the first thing built downtown since then that actually deserves to stand beside it".</p>
