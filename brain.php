        <h2>Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health</h2><br/><br/><h3 class="h3-alt">Las Vegas, Nevada 2009</h3><br/><br/><br/>
        <p class="uppercase">Keep Memory Alive (also known as KMA) was founded by Larry Ruvo, senior managing partner of Southern Wines and Spirits, in memory of his father, Lou Ruvo, a victim of Alzheimer’s Disease, together with his wife Camille, Mirage Resorts CEO Bobby Baldwin (who also lost his father to Alzheimer's Disease), and Bobby Baldwin's wife Donna. KMA supports the mission of the Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health and has held several star-studded galas, attended by celebrities and notables from around the world. It has become one of Las Vegas’ most important charity initiatives and a key participant in the nation fight against Alzheimer's disease. Since its inception, the event has raised more than $20 million towards achieving its goal – the realization of the Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health. Funds committed by such supporters as the Spector Family Foundation, the Roland and Terri Sturm Foundation, Steinberg Diagnostics, the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino and America Online will be utilized for the construction and operation of this state-of-the-art facility. The Center is planned to become a national resource for the most current research and scientific information for the treatment of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington 's Diseases, Multiple Sclerosis and ALS (Lou Gehrig's Disease) as well as focusing on prevention, early detection and education.</p><br/>
        <p>The ceremonial groundbreaking of the Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health occurred on February 9, 2007. Dignitaries who attended the groundbreaking ceremonies for the $70 million project included founder Larry Ruvo, Frank Gehry, U.S. Senator Harry Reid and John Ensign; U.S. Representative Shelley Berkley, Jon Porter and Dean Heller, Gov. Jim Gibbons, Mayor Oscar Goodman, former Gov. Kenny Guinn, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, Kevin Spacey, John Cusack.[2][3] The Center operates as an outpatient treatment and research facility in downtown Las Vegas on land deeded to Keep Memory Alive, the fund raising arm of LRCBH, by the City of Las Vegas as part of its 61 acres (25 ha) Symphony Park. The Center is approximately 65,000 sq ft (6,000 m2) and includes 13 examination rooms, offices for health care practitioners and researchers, a “Museum of the Mind,” and a community auditorium. The Center will also serve as the headquarters for Keep Memory Alive, the Las Vegas Alzheimer’s Association and the Las Vegas Parkinson’s Disease Association.</p><br/>
        <p>On his blog, New Urbanist and architecture critic James Howard Kunstler named the Lou Ruvo center his "Eyesore Of The Month" for April 2010. Kunstler sharply criticized the Center's design, writing: "It seems to say: This is your brain on Frank Gehry". Kunstler suggested that the architecture was inappropriate for the building's purpose: "If I had a problem with my brain, I would not be reassured arriving at this place. The implicit sadism is impressive".
Others laud the design as progressive and a valuable tool in bringing attention and awareness to the building and the practices therein.</p>
